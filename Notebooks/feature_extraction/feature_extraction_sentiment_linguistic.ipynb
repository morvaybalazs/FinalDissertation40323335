    "## Function to Extract Features from CSV Files\n",
    "\n",
    "This function extracts features from CSV files in a given directory. It takes two arguments:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `dir_path`: the directory path containing the CSV files.\n",
    "- `num_docs` (optional): the number of CSV files to process.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function extracts various features such as coherence, spelling and grammar, polarity, and subjectivity using Python libraries like pandas, numpy, nltk, textblob, and language_tool_python.\n",
    "\n",
    "It loops through each CSV file in the directory, extracts the features, and saves the extracted features as a CSV file in a subdirectory called \"features_extracted_2020\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The function prints messages indicating the progress of the feature extraction process. Once all the feature extractions are completed, the function prints a message indicating that the process is finished.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output\n",
    "The function outputs a CSV file for each CSV file containing the extracted features. The CSV files are saved in the \"features_extracted_2020\" subdirectory.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Required Libraries\n",
    "The function requires the following Python libraries:\n",
    "\n",
    "- pandas\n",
    "- numpy\n",
    "- nltk\n",
    "- textblob\n",
    "- language_tool_python"
